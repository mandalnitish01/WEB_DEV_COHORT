# Computer and Network Internal Work

## Computer Internal Work

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- The CPU is the brain of the computer where most calculations take place.
- It performs arithmetic and logical operations.
- It fetches, decodes, and executes instructions from memory.

### Memory
- RAM (Random Access Memory) is the primary memory used for temporary storage while the computer is running.
- ROM (Read-Only Memory) is used for permanent storage of firmware.

### Storage
- Hard Disk Drives (HDD) and Solid State Drives (SSD) are used for long-term data storage.
- Data is stored in binary format and can be retrieved as needed.

### Input/Output Devices
- Input devices include keyboards, mice, and scanners.
- Output devices include monitors, printers, and speakers.

## Network Internal Work

### Network Interface Card (NIC)
- The NIC is a hardware component that connects a computer to a network.
- It converts data into a format suitable for the network medium.

### Routers and Switches
- Routers direct data packets between different networks.
- Switches connect devices within the same network and use MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.

### Protocols
- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) is the fundamental suite of protocols(rules) for the internet.
- HTTP/HTTPS are protocols used for transferring web pages.
- TLS is a protocol used for transferring web pages from a network to a network.
- FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is used for transferring files between computers.
- UDP (UDP Transfer Protocol and Internet Protocol) is used for transferring files between different computer systems and Internet systems.



### Firewalls
- Firewalls monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules.
- They act as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks.

### DNS (Domain Name System)
- DNS translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses.
- It is essential for the functioning of the internet as it allows users to access websites using easy-to-remember names.

### VPN (Virtual Private Network)
- VPNs create a secure connection over a public network.
- They encrypt data to ensure privacy and security.
